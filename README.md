### Some Confidential Info About Me... (NOT GENERATED BY AI)
I solve bugs, But here I proudly create them.

- I code first, break next, panic later, then scroll forums for ages.  
- I eat LLMs for breakfast. (LLM generated this BTW...JK..)
- I also help LLMs, by... rewiring its thought from my out of the world dumb questions.
- Part time coder, full-time debugger. (A classic developer go-to line, works every time)
- Weekends are for overengineering small projects in Python or scoring 4 past the neighborhood kids’ team.  
- Other than pretending to code, I also like to pretend I'm... the next Thomas Edison (I'd beat him in overthinking)
- You can contact me below: (As if I am superstar and you'd be dying to contact me..)
